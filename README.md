Program 1: Class Design / Operator Overloads
**Problem 1: The Vending Bank**
Design (do not implement) a class which models the coin-operated “bank” part of a vending
machine which sells snacks. You only need to design the contract (.h file) and not the
implementation (.cpp file). Here is a start of vending_bank.h with one function already defined.
The data member id_ is a unique identifier for the vending bank.

**Problem 2: TimeSpan**
Design and implement a TimeSpan class which represents a duration of time in hours, minutes,
and seconds. The order hours, minutes, and seconds should be respected in the constructor.
